# ToiletBook

## About

ToiletBook is an application for finding accessible clean washrooms near the user’s location. The cleanliness and overall quality of the washrooms are gauged based on user reviews, as well as other attributes like location, open hours, gender-specificity, price and other available amenities. 

## What problem does it solve?

There have been recent news regarding different inconveniences involving the washrooms. One is about a Petron customer who wasn’t able to to use the washroom facilities in the gas station as it is exclusive only for Petron Value Card holders[1]. Another one is an issue regarding the quality discrepancies between paid and public toilets inside malls and other establishments[2], as well as the complaints about having a unisex public restroom[2]. Lastly, there are also other criticisms regarding the cleanliness of all public restrooms in general[3].

Noticing the current problems the users face due to lack of information about the available washrooms, ToiletBook has been created to provide a solution to fix the discomfort and inconvenience of finding clean and accessible washrooms in public areas and establishments. 

## Why is this relevant?

It’s primary relevance is for convenience, hygiene and sanitation. Users would be able to see washroom datas. As such, they will be able to evaluate the quality and criterias of the washrooms beforehand, which include access information, price (if not free), cleanliness and all amenities available. They will also be able to locate the nearest washroom and get directions from ToiletBook based on the description about the nearby establishments.

Due to the ability of ToiletBook to gather and give data to users regarding washroom quality, this will also help lessen the economic cost of poor sanitation on the economy, health, water resources, welfare and tourism[4]. Overall, the government study estimated that poor sanitation led to economic costs in the order of US$1.4 billion or PhP 77.8 billion per year, which was equivalent to about 1.5% of GDP in 2005 and translated to per capita losses of US$16.8 or PhP 923.69 per year[4].

Giving the users a way to evaluate and review washrooms increases user satisfaction, as well as the competition for paid washroom services.

Lastly, it will hopefully end the need for establishments to write “Bawal ang umihi dito” (You cannot pee here) on their walls.

## How can this solve a social problem?

Knowing the washrooms’ locations, accessibility and cleanliness allows users to easily find one which would provide comfort and convenience to a physical need. It also helps persons-with-disability find washrooms that could cater to them, and assists mothers with infants find washrooms with diaper-changing stations.

The availability of the washroom’s location would discourage  public urination and encourage NGO/government action for the lack of public washrooms[2].

How can this solve an environmental problem?

The availability of the washrooms’ location could, by extension, prevent people from excreting human waste just anywhere especially on bodies of water. Human waste not disposed based on proper regulation will become part of toxic waste which can harm humans, animals, and plants[5]. Humans or animals often absorb them when they eat fish. ToiletBook can help to reduce the production of toxic waste and help with lightening the workload of recycling causes by different programs, such as the household waste collection program advocated by UKEssays in their publishings[5].
